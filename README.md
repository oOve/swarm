# Swarm
Create swarms of monsters and critters that move as one. Rats, bats, ravens, bugs, pretty butterflies or even trolls (who wouldn't want to fight a swarm of trolls?) every token can be made into a swarm.

## Installation
Install by searching for *swarm* in the module browsing tool or manually using this url: https://github.com/oOve/swarm/releases/latest/download/module.json

## Useage

Right click any token (or an actors prototype token) and bring up the token config.

- Enable your swarm by checking the box **Swarm**
- Check the **over** box to have your swarm fly over other tokens/players or leave it unchecked for under. Bats and crows fly over, whereas spiders under.
- **Count** is the number of critters in your swarm
- **Speed** lets you configure the critters individual speeds. Are they moving too fast, reduce this number.
- At last you have a drop-down box where you can choose the swarm animation, see below.

On the next tab: *Appearance*

 - Modify the **Scale** to reduce or increase the size of the individual critters.
 - Change the dimensions to create a larger area where the bugs crawl.
 - Mirror image if your critters e.g., move backward.
 
And you should have your swarm ready for action:

**Note**: The large stationary critter is only visible for the DM, it is your handle to drag around the swarm. If you would like to make this "control token" less obtrusive, lower the opacity in the token config.
 

## Localization
Current support for:
 * English -- https://github.com/oOve 
 * Your language ?

If you want to translate this module, download [this file](lang/en.json) and translate it. After that open an issue sharing your translation. Also share the default name convention for your language. You can find that by either, finding a system or module that is already translated to your language and open its module.json. It should look something like this: ``` "languages": [ { "lang": "en", "name": "English", "path": "lang/en.json" } ```

## Compatibility
Tested on [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/  "Foundry VTT") version `9`, version 10 coming soon.
